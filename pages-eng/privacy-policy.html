                <br>one@fly.com<br>
                Phone: 312312312<br>
                We appreciate your interest in our online shop. Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Below
                we provide you with detailed information on how we handle your data.<br>
                1. Access data and hosting<br>
                You can visit our websites without providing any personal information. With each visit to a webpage, the
                web server automatically stores a so-called server log file, which includes access data, such as the
                name of the requested file, your IP address, date and time of access, transferred data volume, and the
                requesting provider, and documents the access. These access data are evaluated solely for the purpose of
                ensuring the smooth operation of the site and improving our offer. This serves to protect our overriding
                legitimate interests in a correct presentation of our offer in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
                GDPR. All access data are deleted no later than seven days after the end of your page visit.<br>
                2. Data processing for contract processing and for contact purposes<br>
                2.1 Data processing for contract processing<br>
                For the purpose of contract processing (including inquiries about and processing of any existing
                warranty and performance disruption claims, as well as any statutory obligation to update) in accordance
                with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, we collect personal data if you voluntarily provide it to us within the
                scope of your order. Mandatory fields are marked as such, as in these cases we require the data for
                contract processing and cannot ship the order without it. Which data is collected can be seen from the
                respective input forms. For more information about how your data is processed, particularly about its
                disclosure to our service providers for the purpose of order, payment, and shipping processing, please
                refer to the following sections of this privacy policy. After complete processing of the contract, your
                data will be restricted for further processing and deleted after the expiry of the retention periods
                under tax and commercial law in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR, unless you have expressly
                consented to further use of your data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or we reserve the
                right to use your data for other purposes that are legally permissible and about which we inform you in
                this policy.<br>
                2.2 Customer account<br>
                If you have given your consent to this in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR by choosing to open
                a customer account, we use your data for the purpose of opening a customer account and storing your data
                for further future orders on our website. You can delete your customer account at any time, either by
                sending a message to the contact option described in this privacy policy or by using a function provided
                for this purpose in your customer account. After deletion of your customer account, your data will be
                deleted, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data in accordance with Art. 6 para.
                1 lit. a GDPR or we reserve the right to use your data for other purposes that are legally permissible
                and about which we inform you in this policy.<br>
                2.3 Contacting us<br>
                Within the framework of customer communication, we collect personal data to process your inquiries in
                accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR if you voluntarily provide it to us when
                contacting us (e.g. via contact form or email). Mandatory fields are marked as such because in these
                cases we need the data to process your contact request. The data collected is apparent from the
                respective input forms. After complete processing of your request, your data will be deleted unless you
                have expressly consented to further use of your data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a
                GDPR or we reserve the right to use your data beyond that, which is legally permitted and about which we
                will inform you in this declaration.<br>
                Live chat tool WhatsApp<br>
                For the purpose of customer communication, we use the live chat tool of WhatsApp Ireland Limited, 4
                Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("WhatsApp"). This serves to protect our
                predominant legitimate interests in effective and improved customer communication in accordance with
                Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR within the framework of a balancing of interests. WhatsApp acts on
                our behalf. The telephone numbers stored by us on our mobile device are automatically processed on
                servers of Meta Platforms, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA. Only telephone numbers
                of customers who have previously contacted us via WhatsApp and have already accepted WhatsApp's terms of
                use and privacy policy will be saved. There is no adequacy decision of the European Commission for the
                USA. Our cooperation is based on standard data protection clauses of the European Commission.<br>
                3. Data processing for the purpose of shipping processing<br>
                For the purpose of contract fulfillment in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, we
                will pass on your data to the shipping service provider commissioned with the delivery, insofar as this
                is necessary for the delivery of ordered goods.<br>
                4. Data processing for payment processing<br>
                When processing payments in our online shop, we cooperate with the following partners: technical service
                providers, credit institutions, payment service providers.
                4.1 Data processing for transaction processing<br>
                Depending on the selected payment method, we will pass on the data necessary for the processing of the
                payment transaction to our technical service providers, who act on our behalf as part of order
                processing, or to the commissioned credit institutions or the selected payment service provider, insofar
                as this is necessary for the processing of the payment. This serves to fulfill the contract in
                accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. In some cases, the payment service providers
                collect the data required for processing the payment themselves, e.g. on their own website or via
                technical integration in the ordering process. In this respect, the data protection declaration of the
                respective payment service provider applies. If you have any questions about our partners for payment
                processing and the basis of our cooperation with them, please contact us using the contact information
                described in this privacy policy.
                4.2 Data processing for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimization of our payment processes<br>
                If necessary, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data
                necessary for processing the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and
                optimization of our payment processes (e.g. invoicing, handling disputed payments, supporting
                accounting). This serves to protect our legitimate interests, which prevail in the context of a balance
                of interests, pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, in securing ourselves against fraud and in
                efficient payment management.<br>

                Email advertising<br>

                separately by you to send you our email newsletter on a regular basis based on your consent pursuant to
                Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR.<br>
                You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time, either by sending a message to the contact option
                described below or via a link provided in the newsletter.<br>
                After unsubscribing, we will delete your email address from the recipient list, unless you have
                expressly consented to further use of your data pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR or we
                reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in
                this declaration.
                We would like to point out that we evaluate your user behavior when sending the newsletter. For this
                purpose, we also analyze your handling of our newsletter by measuring, storing and evaluating the
                opening and click-through rates for the purpose of designing future newsletter campaigns ("newsletter
                tracking"). For this evaluation, the emails sent contain one-pixel technologies (e.g. so-called web
                beacons, tracking pixels) that are stored on our website. For the evaluations, we link, in particular,
                the following "newsletter data" with your email address or your IP address and, if applicable, an
                individual ID: the page from which the page was requested (so-called referrer URL), the date and time of
                the request, the description of the type of web browser used, the IP address of the requesting computer,
                the email address, the date and time of registration and confirmation, and the one-pixel technologies.

                can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time, as described above. The information will be stored as
                long as you have subscribed to the newsletter.<br>
                5.2 Newsletter dispatch<br>
                The newsletter and the newsletter tracking shown above may also be sent by our service providers as part
                of processing on our behalf. If you have any questions about our service providers and the basis of our
                cooperation with them, please contact the contact option described in this privacy policy.<br>
                Our service providers are based in and/or use servers in the USA. There is no adequacy decision by the
                European Commission for the USA. Our cooperation with them is based on standard data protection clauses
                of the European Commission.<br>
                6. Cookies and other technologies<br>
                General Information<br>

                will be deleted. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. Further information
                on your options for revocation can be found in the "Cookies and other technologies" section. Further

                Commission for the USA. Our cooperation is based on standard data protection clauses of the European
                Commission. If your IP address is collected through the Adobe technologies, it will be shortened or
                completely replaced by a generic IP address before being stored on Adobe's servers through the
                activation of appropriate settings.
                Adobe Fonts<br>
                To ensure a consistent presentation of the content on our website, data (IP address, time of visit,
                device and browser information) is collected by the script code "Adobe Fonts", transmitted to Adobe and
                then processed by Adobe. We have no influence on this subsequent data processing. The data processing is
                based on an agreement between joint controllers in accordance with Art. 26 GDPR.
                7.2 Use of Google services for web analysis and advertising purposes<br>
                We use the technologies of Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland
                ("Google"), as shown below. The information about your use of our website automatically collected by the
                Google technologies is usually transmitted to a server of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain
                View, CA 94043, USA and stored there. There is no adequacy decision of the European Commission for the
                USA. Our cooperation with them is based on standard data protection clauses of the European Commission.
                If your IP address is collected through the Google technologies, it will be shortened before being
                stored on Google servers by activating IP anonymization. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP
                address be transmitted to a Google server and then shortened. Unless otherwise indicated for the
                individual technologies, data processing is based on an agreement between joint controllers in
                accordance with Art. 26 GDPR for the respective technology. Further information on data processing by
                Google can be found in Google's privacy policy.
                Google Analytics<br>
                For the purpose of website analysis, data (IP address, time of visit, device and browser information as
                well as information about your use of our website) is automatically collected and stored with Google
                Analytics, from which usage profiles are created using pseudonyms. Cookies may be used for this purpose.
                Your IP address is generally not merged with other data from Google. The data processing is based on an
                agreement for order processing by Google.<br>
                For the purpose of optimized marketing of our website, we have enabled the data sharing settings for
                "Google products and services". This allows Google to access and use the data collected and processed by
                Google Analytics to improve Google services. The data sharing with Google within the scope of these data
                sharing settings is based on an additional agreement between controllers. We have no influence on the
                subsequent data processing by Google.<br>
                For the purpose of optimized marketing of our website, we use the so-called user ID function. With the
                help of this function, we can assign a unique, permanent ID to your interaction data for one or more
                sessions on our online presence and thus analyze your user behavior across devices and sessions.
                We also use the extension function of Google Analytics, Google Optimize, for the creation and execution
                of tests.
                The extension function of Google Analytics, Google Signals, enables so-called "cross-device tracking"
                for web analysis. If your internet-enabled devices are linked to your Google account and you have
                activated "personalized advertising" in your Google account, Google can create reports on your usage
                behavior (especially cross-device user numbers), even if you change your end device. We do not process
                any personal data in this regard; we only receive statistics based on Google Signals.<br>
                The extension function of Google Analytics, DoubleClick cookie, allows recognition of your browser when
                visiting other websites for web analysis and advertising purposes. Google will use this information to
                compile reports on website activity and to provide further services related to website usage. Google
                AdSense<br>
                Our website markets space for third-party advertisements through Google AdSense. These advertisements
                will be displayed to you at various places on this website. The so-called DoubleClick cookie enables the
                display of interest-based advertising by collecting and processing data (IP address, time of visit,
                device and browser information, as well as information about your use of our website) and automatically
                assigning a pseudonymous user ID, which helps determine interests based on visits to this and other
                websites.
                <br>
                Google Ads<br>
                For advertising purposes in Google search results and on third-party websites, the so-called Google
                Remarketing cookie is set when you visit our website, allowing interest-based advertising to be
                displayed automatically through the collection and processing of data (IP address, time of visit, device
                and browser information, as well as information about your use of our website) and with the help of a
                pseudonymous cookie ID and based on the pages you have visited. Further data processing only takes place
                if you have activated the "personalized advertising" setting in your Google account. If you are logged
                in to Google during your visit to our website in this case, Google will use your data together with
                Google Analytics data to create and define target audience lists for cross-device remarketing.

                For website analysis and event tracking, we use Google Ads conversion tracking to measure your
                subsequent usage behavior when you arrive on our website via a Google Ads advertisement. For this
                purpose, cookies may be used, and data (IP address, time of visit, device and browser information, as
                well as information about your use of our website based on events we specify, such as visiting a website
                or signing up for a newsletter) may be collected to create usage profiles using pseudonyms.
                <br>
                Google Fonts<br>
                To ensure a uniform display of content on our website, data (IP address, time of visit, device and
                browser information) is collected through the script code "Google Fonts," transmitted to Google, and
                subsequently processed by Google. We have no control over this subsequent data processing.
                <br>
                7.3 Use of Facebook Services for Web Analysis and Advertising Purposes<br>
                Use of Facebook Pixel<br>
                We use the Facebook Pixel as part of the technologies described below of Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd., 4
                Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook (by Meta)" or "Meta Platforms Ireland"). Data (IP
                address, time of visit, device and browser information, as well as information about your use of our
                website based on events we specify, such as visiting a website or signing up for a newsletter) is
                automatically collected and stored using the Facebook Pixel to create usage profiles using
                pseudonyms.<br>
                In the context of the so-called extended data matching, information for matching purposes is also
                collected and hashed, which can be used to identify individuals (e.g., names, email addresses, and phone
                numbers).<br>
                For this purpose, a cookie is automatically set by the Facebook Pixel when you visit our website, which
                allows recognition of your browser automatically by means of a pseudonymous cookie ID when you visit
                other websites. Facebook (by Meta) will merge this information with other data from your Facebook
                account and use it to compile reports on website activities and to provide other services related to
                website usage, particularly personalized and group-based advertising. The information automatically
                collected by the Facebook (by Meta) technologies regarding your use of our website is generally
                transferred to a server of Meta Platforms, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA and
                stored there. The European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision for the USA. If the transfer
                of data to the USA falls under our responsibility, our cooperation is based on standard data protection
                clauses of the European Commission. Further information <br>
                Within the Facebook Business Tools, statistics on visitor activity on our website are created from the
                data collected by the Facebook Pixel. This data processing is based on an agreement on order processing
                by Facebook (by Meta). The analysis serves for the optimal presentation and marketing of our website. We
                advertise for this website on Facebook (by Meta) and other platforms through Facebook Ads. We determine
                the parameters of each advertising campaign, but Facebook (by Meta) is responsible for the exact
                implementation, particularly the decision on the placement of ads for individual users. Unless otherwise
                indicated in the individual technologies, data processing is based on an agreement between joint
                controllers according to Art. 26 GDPR, which is limited to the collection of data and its transmission
                to Meta Platforms Ireland. The subsequent data processing by Meta Platforms Ireland is not covered by
                this. We operate group-based advertising on Facebook (by Meta) through Facebook Custom Audience by
                determining the characteristics of the respective target group based on statistics created via Facebook
                Pixel on visitor activity on our website. Facebook (by Meta) acts as our processor in the extended data
                match used to determine the respective target group. We run personalized advertising through Facebook
                Pixel Remarketing based on the pseudonymous cookie ID set by Facebook Pixel and the data collected on
                your usage behavior on our website. We use Facebook Pixel Conversions to measure your subsequent usage
                behavior for web analysis and event tracking if you accessed our website through a Facebook Ads
                advertisement. Data processing is based on an agreement on order processing by Facebook (by Meta). We
                use the Vimeo video plugin to integrate third-party content. Data (IP address, time of visit, device and
                browser information) is collected via the video plugin from Vimeo LLC, 555 West 18th Street, New York
                10011, USA ("Vimeo"), transmitted to Vimeo and then processed by Vimeo. Data processing is based on an
                agreement between joint controllers according to Art. 26 GDPR. Google Analytics is automatically
                integrated into the Vimeo Video Plugin. For the purpose of website analysis, data (IP address, time of
                visit, device and browser information as well as information on your use of our website) is
                automatically collected and stored with Google Analytics, from which usage profiles are created using
                pseudonyms. Cookies may be used for this purpose. Google Analytics is offered by Google Ireland Ltd.,
                Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google"). Information about your use of our website,
                which is automatically collected by Google, is usually transferred to and stored on a server of Google
                LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Your IP address is shortened before storage
                on Google's servers by activating IP anonymization. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address
                transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. We have no influence or access on the
                data processing by Vimeo, including the settings and results of Google Analytics. There is no adequacy
                decision of the European Commission for the USA. Our cooperation with them is based on standard data
                protection clauses of the European Commission. Social media is addressed in section 8.
                8.1 Social Plugins from Instagram (by Meta), Whatsapp<br>
                On our website, social buttons from social networks are used. These are only integrated into the page as
                HTML links,
                so that no connection is made with the servers of the respective provider when our website is accessed.
                If you click
                on one of the buttons, the website of the respective social network opens in a new window of your
                browser. There you
                can, for example, click the Like or Share button.
                8.2 Our online presence on Instagram (by Meta)<br>

                used, for example, to display advertisements within and outside the platforms that presumably correspond
                to your interests.
                Cookies are usually used for this purpose. Please refer to the data protection information of the
                providers linked below
                for detailed information on the processing and use of the data by the respective social media operator,
                as well as contact
                options and your rights and settings options for protecting your privacy. If you still need help in this
                regard, you can
